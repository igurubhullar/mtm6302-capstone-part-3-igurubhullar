REASON FOR CHOOSING COLORS AND SIMPLE DESIGN
Color Choices:
Emotional Connection: I picked calming colors like soft blue for correct answers. Blue has this trustworthy vibe, making it feel like a supportive friend cheering you on when you get something right. For incorrect answers, I used a bold red—it’s eye-catching and lets you know you need to rethink that choice without being too harsh.
Easy to See: I wanted to make sure that the colors stood out. The contrast helps users quickly identify what’s right and wrong, which is super important when they’re trying to learn.
User Experience:

Simple and Clear: I aimed for a clean, straightforward design. I believe less is more; the focus should be on the questions, not on a busy background. The buttons are large and friendly, making it easy to click on them—no awkward fumbling!
Instant Feedback: When users select an answer, I wanted them to feel something immediately. The colors change to give feedback, which I think adds a layer of engagement and helps users understand their progress.
Functional Design:

Smooth Interaction: I designed the app to load questions dynamically so that users can keep the flow going without interruptions. It’s like keeping the momentum of a good conversation—it feels natural and seamless.
Accessibility Matters: I kept accessibility in mind by ensuring that those who might have trouble with colors can still navigate the app easily. It’s important to me that everyone feels included.
Aesthetics:

Modern Vibe: I wanted a fresh, modern look, so I added rounded buttons and subtle hover effects. It makes the app feel welcoming and fun, almost like an inviting café where you want to hang out.
Minimalism is Key: By keeping the design minimalistic, I’ve avoided clutter. This allows users to concentrate fully on the quiz, making the experience enjoyable rather than overwhelming.
Cohesive Design:

Consistency is Comforting: I made sure that all the elements, like fonts and button styles, match throughout the app. This consistency helps users feel more at home and builds a visual identity that they can recognize and trust.
